Crowd Statistics and Visualization

This file demonstrates three statistical and visualization concepts using Python.

1. Trimmed Mean

The trimmed mean removes the lowest 10% and highest 10% values from the dataset before calculating the average. 
This helps reduce the effect of outliers and gives a more accurate estimate.

2. Basic Plotting

Basic plotting is used to visualize data points and understand patterns. 
Different plot styles such as dots, lines, and shapes help represent data clearly.

3. Mean and Median Visualization

This part compares crowd estimates using trimmed data. 
It visualizes the mean and median to show how central values represent the dataset.
 Mean and median help understand the true center of the data, especially when outliers exist.

Purpose

The purpose of this file is to demonstrate how statistics and visualization can improve accuracy
 and understanding of real-world data such as crowd estimation.
